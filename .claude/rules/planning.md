# Planning

**For every new instruction, create a plan** in the `plans/` folder using `template.md` as a base:

- Plans act as high-level guidance for implementation
- Focus on mandatory steps only, avoid excessive detail
- Keep plans simple and concise
- Avoid over-elaboration, detailed sections, or comprehensive documentation style
- Plans should be brief, actionable outlines rather than detailed specifications
- Use checkable steps (markdown checkboxes) to track progress
- Update `state` field as work progresses: `todo` → `progress` → `complete`
- Always use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify ambiguous requirements before finalizing the plan
